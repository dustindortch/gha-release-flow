description: Builds a strategy matrix based on GitHub Actions environments, filtering on an environment variable specified by "filter-on" and a vlaue specified by "filter-by".  Returns JSON list of environments.

inputs:
  app-id:
    description: GitHub App "app id" with 'read' permissions for "Environments" and "Variables".  Safe to store as repository "variable".
    required: true
  private-key:
    description: GitHub App "private key" associated with "app id".  Safe to store as repository "secret".
    required: true
  filter-on:
    default: 'RELEASE'
    description: Environment variable to filter on.  Defaults to "RELEASE".  Safe to store as repository "variable".
    required: false
  filter-by:
    default: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    description: Value to filter environment variable by.  Defaults to 'github.ref_name'.
    required: false
outputs:
  matrix:
    description: Strategy matrix listing all environments matching "filter-on" and "filter-by".  Use in subsequent job as `fromJson(needs.<job_name>.outputs.matrix' and within 'environment' as 'matrix.environment'.
    value: ${{ fromJson(steps.create-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}
